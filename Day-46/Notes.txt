Hie so today is the forty-sixth day of my #100DaysOfCode and below mentioned points 
will give you an overview of what I have learnt today -

1) As today was not a great day for me, didn't felt like doing anything but still to 
    maintain consistency I searched some concepts of javascript which I might have 
    missed. 
2) So I learnt about 'Promises' in javascript from W3 Schools.
3) What are promises.
4) What is consuming and produncing code.
5) Properties of promise object.
6) With a basic syntax and how it is been achieved.
