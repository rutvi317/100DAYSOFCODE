Given three values of different data types. You are required to store these values in variables of corresponding data type and output them.

Input:
The only line of input contains three space separated values of different types.
Description of  data types of the values:
1) First value will be of integer type.
2) Second value will be of character type.
3) Third value will be of type float.

Output:
