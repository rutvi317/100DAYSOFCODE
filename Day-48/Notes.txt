Hie so today is the forty-eighth day of my #100DaysOfCode and below mentioned points 
will give you an overview of what I have learnt today -

1) What do you understand by React Lifecycle.
2) How it works.
3) What three events are involved in the lifecycle.
4) What are the methods that are been called inside those events and what is 
     the sequence in which they are been called.
5) Implemented only the methods called inside the first event (Component mounted)
    and consoled the sequence in which methods are been called.
