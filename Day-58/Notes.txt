Hie so today is the fifty-eigth day of my #100DaysOfCode and below mentioned points 
will give you an overview of what I have learnt today -

1) Not learnt anything new instead revised the old concepts just in case I don't forget anything 
    and to get a better clarity.
2) Done some practical implementations as well.
