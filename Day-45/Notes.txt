Hie so today is the forty-fifth day of my #100DaysOfCode and below mentioned points 
will give you an overview of what I have learnt today -

1) I learnt the javascript concepts in depth by learning from the website 
    "https://javascript.info/" as I had some doubts and wanted to clear them.

2) Apart from this I started learning 'props' in react but as I am not clear with
    the whole idea and implementation from what I learnt today so would be 
    doing it again tomorrow and posting about it.
